In this repository is a formalization of the work of George Metcalfe, Nicola Olivetti and Dov Gabbay in Sequent and hypersequent calculi for abelian and lukasiewicz logics made during my internship at Laboratoire de l'Informatique et du Parall√©lisme under the supervision of Matteo Mio.
The report can be read to better understand our work and how this repository is structured.
